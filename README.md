Documents and files related to the statistics journal club at Psykiatri Sydväst. The [*Discovering Statistics* book](https://www.discoveringstatistics.com/books/discovering-statistics-using-r/) is also available for R.

# Getting started

First, download [R](https://cran.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) and open up RStudio. You are now up and running! The scripts that I upload here can be viewed and used through RStudio to replicate some of the exercises we do in our Statistics workshops.

Here are a few guides to get started doing data analysis in R:
* [Modern dive: Free E-book](https://moderndive.com)
* [R for Data Science: Free E-book. I really recommend chapters 1-15](http://r4ds.had.co.nz)
* [Getting Started in R 8-page PDF guide](https://github.com/saghirb/Getting-Started-in-R)
* [Explore statistics with R: Course from Karolinska Institutet](https://www.edx.org/course/explore-statistics-r-kix-kiexplorx-0)
* [Introduction to R on Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r)
* [Data manipulation in R on Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/dplyr-data-manipulation-r-tutorial)
* [RStudio cheatsheets for common actions](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)

There are tons of online resources in the forms of blog posts and answers on forums. I collect some links I find helpful [here](https://www.notion.so/R-Stats-e85672c2481345e5bc2075fa38ac6ff8). Try pasting your error message into Google, almost always someone has had the same problem and there is a simple solution. Also try searching for your particular need, like "missing values in t-test in R".
