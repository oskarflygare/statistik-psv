# Is there an interaction (moderation) between Vid_Game and CaUnTs?
fit3 <- lm(Aggress ~ Vid_Game * CaUnTs, data = df_data)

# Yes!

# Add quartiles for the variables, similar to what is done in the book

# We need three models: Using just the predictor variable, just the mediator, and then both predictor and mediator

fit_m1 <- lm(Phys_Inf ~ LnPorn, data = df_lambert)
summary(fit_m1)

fit_m2 <- lm(Commit ~ LnPorn, data = df_lambert)
summary(fit_m2)

fit_m3 <- lm(Phys_Inf ~ LnPorn + Commit, data = df_lambert)
summary(fit_m3)

# So LnPorn has an estimate of .59 in model 1, but it is only .46 in model 3. Some mediation here!

# Andy Fields suggests some other analyses that are better but I didn't have time to analyze them.
